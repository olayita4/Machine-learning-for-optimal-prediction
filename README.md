# Machine-learning-for-optimal-prediction
The purpose of this project was to implement to some machine learning techniques for optimal prediction in a large unlabeled data set. For the supervised learning part, I utilized SVM with linear, polynomial kernel, radial basis function kernel, logistic regression, regression tree, and random forest. For the unsupervised learning task, I used PCA and K-means. Furthermore, I used caret package for parameter tuning. The parameter Kappa was the test statistic.
